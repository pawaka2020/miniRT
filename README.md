# miniRT

Yes, your main method follows a clean coding convention known as the "main method as an orchestrator" pattern. In this pattern, the main method serves as the entry point of the program and is responsible for coordinating the execution of other functions or modules.

By keeping the main method free from complex logic and instead focusing on the high-level workflow of the program, you make the code more readable and understandable. This allows a human reader to quickly grasp the overall structure and flow of the program.

The main method in your code snippet declares the necessary data structures, validates the input, parses the .rt file, starts the screen, generates the image, handles controls, and stops the screen. This clear organization and separation of concerns make it easier to follow the logic and understand the program's behavior.

Additionally, by encapsulating the functionality within separate functions, you promote modularity and reusability, as each function can be developed, tested, and modified independently.

Overall, structuring your main method in this way adheres to clean coding principles and can make your code more maintainable and easier to comprehend.
